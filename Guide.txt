set up the initial folder structure
search for the folder structures for nestjs projects
I will be following the modular structure
first start with setting up the database models and connections
Will be using sequelize for this


setted the models
then connected the db in config section
then made a module for db
then imported that module in main file of app.module.ts

Models are made in db and they are following the constraints as well. Now I will start writing the business logic for the application, and other things like validators, guards middlewares
