set up the initial folder structure
search for the folder structures for nestjs projects
I will be following the modular structure
first start with setting up the database models and connections
Will be using sequelize for this


setted the models
then connected the db in config section
then made a module for db
then imported that module in main file of app.module.ts

Models are made in db and they are following the constraints as well. Now I will start writing the business logic for the application, and other things like validators, guards middlewares


npx sequelize migration:create --name add-some-table

will just generate a migration file, in path specified in .sequelizerc


const { resolve } = require('path');

module.exports = {
  config: resolve('src/config/sequelize.config.js'),
  'seeders-path': resolve('dist/database/seeders'),
  'migrations-path': resolve('dist/database/migrations'),
  'models-path': resolve('dist/database/models'),
};


actually this is important as now you have ts files and you have to consider js files so go for that dist folder

const { resolve } = require('path');

module.exports = {
  config: resolve('src/config/sequelize.config.js'),
  'seeders-path': resolve('src/database/seeders'),
  'migrations-path': resolve('src/database/migrations'),
  'models-path': resolve('dist/database/models'),
};

chnaged these to src as create migration and seeders in src directory then changes file extension and so again back to previou sequelizerc file.

npx sequelize-cli db:migrate  
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all


Now start working on the business logic


Suggested Order of Development:
Modular Structure: Define the module structure for the app (UserModule, PostModule, CommentModule, etc.).
Controllers & Services: Create simple controllers and services for core features (CRUD operations, DB interactions).
Authentication: Set up authentication with JWT and implement login, registration, and protected routes.
Authorization & Guards: Add guards to secure routes based on user roles and permissions.
Typeguards & Validation: Ensure all request inputs are type-checked and validated.
Middlewares & Interceptors: Introduce middleware for logging, security, or request preprocessing. Use interceptors for cross-cutting concerns like response transformation and error handling.
This approach allows you to have a working version of the application quickly while maintaining the flexibility to scale and secure it progressively.


First start with user module keep in mind the flow of the applicationa as well, like how to write code
define the data transfer objects
define the service
define the controller
define the module
import that module in main module

so this is flow

Now add global error handling mechanism as well







See how to remove any from services
add your authmiddleware in main file as in app.module.ts specified in prompt, and then test, then add customized services and then further more things
see how and where you use APP_GUARD globally
